__Description__: If the prvious `identity` was an Array of Function(s) and the current `identity` is as well then the `identity` Functions should be join to test all `identity` Functions

__Notes__

+ If `everyIdentity` then every test must pass, otherwise it will pass on first validy `identity` Function regardless

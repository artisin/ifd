__Description__: Should be able to have complete control over an identity return if the Function returns an Object whos only keys are `pass` and `val`. The `pass` key value is a Boolean value which determains if the condition passes and should return the `val` value.

__Notes__

+ The idea here is to allow you to have complete control over the identity return otherwise it will just return the value of the passing condition.
